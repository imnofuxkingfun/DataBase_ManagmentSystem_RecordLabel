# Record Label Database Management System (SQL and PL/SQL)  

## Project Overview  
This project is a database management system designed to store and manage information related to one or more record labels. It includes tables for record labels, contracts, musicians, bands, albums, songs, instruments, and employees. The system ensures efficient data organization and retrieval using SQL and PL/SQL functionalities such as stored procedures, triggers, functions, and packages.

## Features  
- Structured relational model with normalization to ensure data integrity  
- Use of primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for efficient data management  
- Implementation of stored procedures for complex operations  
- Use of cursors and collections for advanced data manipulation  
- Triggers for enforcing business rules and automating updates  
- Package implementation for better modularity and reusability  

## Implementation Details  
The database is implemented using SQL and PL/SQL on Oracle. It allows managing record label operations such as handling contracts, tracking musicians and their bands, organizing albums and songs, and managing employees with specific roles like band managers, contract administrators, marketing researchers, and audio engineers.  

This project provides a well-documented, complex and optimized solution for managing record label data efficiently.
